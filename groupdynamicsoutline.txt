Experiential:
Give an actual task to small groups.  
Keep the same teams throughout the full course, really allow dynamics to form and evolve.
This is a big part of the actual learning in the course.  Being on a small team and introspecting about the experience with the group and aid of prompts/facilitators.
"There will be a grade." Need to activate desire to perform…maybe make two groups and frame it as a friendly competition.  "We'll compare outcomes from the two groups."  
This should be a light enough touch to inspire performance anxiety and allow some velcro between people and role.
Maybe midway through the task, we give them an update about how the other group is performing.
Working with what outside information does within the system, how the group interacts with other groups "out there"
Discuss the dynamics that emerged, look at roles that members took up
What roles emerged?
How did you feel about your role?
Was it familiar?
What emotions were individuals holding for the system
What can we notice about Boundaries, Authority, Role, Task
What alliances/connections formed within the group?
What thoughts, fantasies, or feelings did they have about the other group?
What material felt off-limits in the group?


Then have a sessions where we talk together about the group dynamics that occurred.
